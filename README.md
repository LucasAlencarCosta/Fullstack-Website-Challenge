# Fullstack-Website-Challenge

This is a fullstack project that implements a complete authentication cycle using JavaScript, Express, JWT, Bcrypt, SQLite, and other necessary libraries. The main objective of this project is to create a frontend using only HTML and CSS, without relying on any frontend libraries or frameworks like React or Angular. I didn't complete the frontend ui because the main logic and challenge already have been completed.

## Features

- Authentication cycle:
  - User registration
  - User login

- Backend:
  - Built with Express.js
  - SQLite for database storage
  - JWT for authentication
  - Password hashing with Bcrypt
  - Authentication using JWT

- Frontend:
  - Just HTML and CSS (That is the challenge)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Express.js
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Bcrypt (for password hashing)
- SQLite
